## Design Philosophy

Omega draws inspiration from Rust, one of the most loved programming languages for its performance, reliability, and productivity. Like Rust, Omega is designed to be a statically typed, compiled language, offering the benefits of type safety and efficient execution.

However, Omega simplifies the syntax and reduces complexity, making it more accessible, especially for those new to programming.

## Features at a Glance

- __Statically Typed:__ Every variable and expression type is known at compile time, reducing runtime errors and increasing code reliability.
- __Compiled:__ Omega code is compiled into efficient machine code, aiming for fast execution and optimal resource use.
- __Simplified Syntax:__ Borrowing from Rust's expressive syntax, Omega aims to maintain clarity and conciseness, making it easier to read and write code.
- __Beginner-Friendly:__ With a focus on simplicity and an intuitive syntax, Omega is designed to be approachable for newcomers.
- __Function-Centric:__ Functions are a core construct in Omega, facilitating modular and reusable code.
