## Welcome to Omega

Welcome to the Omega programming language!

Omega is a new, compiled language designed with simplicity and power in mind, and is self-described as The General Purpose Programming Language.

Our goal is to provide a language that is easy to learn and use, while also being capable of performing just about any task necesssary, no matter the complexity.

Omega is currently in its infancy, but we're working hard to add features and improve the language.

This website serves as the primary source of documentation for Omega programmers.
