Omega has been born.

Those that know me know I tend to have pretty lofty goals. In addition to this, I'm constantly working on creating _something_. My mind (and thus, my hands), simply won't allow me to rest.

One of those goals just so happens to be creating a programming language of my own design.

Ever since I was a kid, I've been fascinated by computers. They allowed me access to a world that I didn't know existed and provided me with the tools necessary to create whatever my heart desired.

As of today, I'm happy to unveil the beginnings of my latest work: a general-purpose programming language.

Sure, there are already tons of languages out there to choose from, with massive community support behind them. But after reading the story of how other great languages came into existence (Ruby, Rust, and JavaScript were all created by one guy initially), it spurred me into finally taking the steps to bring this project to life.

Obviously, Omega is still in the _extremely_ early stages. But over time, I hope to rectify that - bring it to a point where it's more than usable.
